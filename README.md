This project is unfinished. But has had hours of time invested in it. With all the best to Veritone and team I feel it is an unreasonable ask to complete this project as a takehome. I have a job, I have other interviews, also I have dogs and family I want to see and spend time with. My suggestion would be to include the mui components in the design file to speed along the process. Another suggestion would be to possibly give a boiler plate project for those engineers who are unfamiliar with project set up (like with fonts set up, app rendering, npm scripts set up, theme, etc) as project set up is a process that most people don't go through very often especially at very large companies. These are my heartfelt opinions, and I hope they help in the future or help understand why I did not finish this project. Thank you.
